## üåê HTTP Traffic Interception Analysis

### 4. Network Traffic Capture with Wireshark
After identifying the web services running on port 80 (HTTP) on host 192.168.192.128, I performed network traffic analysis to demonstrate the security risks of unencrypted HTTP communications.

**Tools Used**:
- **Wireshark** - Network protocol analyzer
- **Target**: HTTP login form on 192.168.192.128

### HTTP Login Credential Interception
```bash
# Started Wireshark capture on eth0 interface
# Accessed HTTP login page via browser
# Submitted login credentials through insecure form
```

**Captured Traffic Analysis**:
From the Wireshark capture, I was able to identify the following:

**HTTP POST Request Details**:
- **Source IP**: 192.168.192.128
- **Destination IP**: 65.61.137.117
- **Protocol**: HTTP/1.1
- **Method**: POST
- **Content-Type**: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

**Intercepted Credentials**:
```
Form Data (Plain Text):
- Username Field: "admin"
- Password Field: "admin" 
- Submit Action: "Login"
```

**Security Implications**:
1. **Credentials Transmitted in Clear Text**: Login credentials are visible in plain text within the HTTP request
2. **No Encryption**: HTTP traffic is unencrypted and easily intercepted
3. **Network Eavesdropping**: Anyone monitoring network traffic can capture sensitive information
4. **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**: Attackers can intercept and modify HTTP traffic

### Key Observations from Traffic Capture
- **Packet Analysis**: HTTP form data clearly shows username "admin" and password "admin"
- **Request Headers**: Standard HTTP headers with no security mechanisms
- **Form Encoding**: URL-encoded form data transmission
- **Network Path**: Traffic traverses multiple network hops without protection

### Recommendations for Secure Communication
1. **Implement HTTPS**: Use SSL/TLS encryption for all authentication
2. **Password Hashing**: Never transmit passwords in plain text
3. **Secure Headers**: Implement security headers (HSTS, CSP)
4. **Network Segmentation**: Isolate sensitive communications
5. **VPN Usage**: Encrypt network traffic at the transport layer

## üö® Combined Security Assessment Update

### Additional Vulnerabilities Identified
4. **Insecure HTTP Authentication** (192.168.192.128)
   - Login credentials transmitted in plain text
   - No SSL/TLS encryption implemented
   - Susceptible to network eavesdropping
   - Credentials: admin/admin (weak default credentials)

### Enhanced Security Recommendations
4. **Implement Secure Authentication**
   - Force HTTPS for all login pages
   - Use strong password policies
   - Implement multi-factor authentication
   - Regular credential rotation
